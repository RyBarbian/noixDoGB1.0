# noixDoG BETA v1.0.1 Official Development Repo


This is in BETA. No gurantee any pulls/clones will actually work as of today, 3/2/18. 

Any user of this technology assumes all risk without fault of the Development Team/RAD/DRNA or any of its citizins. 




noixDoG is an inexpensive and decentralized ledger to be used by businesses for tracking share ownership of gold (Au) in an automated fashion. Shares can be transferred and held just like other cryptocurrency units, such as peercoins or bitcoins.

Using noixDoG, individuals, businesses, or organizations of any size could raise funding through an initial offering without depending on a third party such as a stock exchange. While trading shares through exchanges will be useful to provide liquidity, noixDoG will be traded on any number of exchanges. 

Each business using noixDoG can have their own blockchain that is independent of all others if they so desire, although this is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS to investment. Blockchains can be secured cheaply and easily using noixDoG's proof-of-stake, once the initial (issuer-controlled) quantity of shares have been generated using proof-of-work.

Issuers can distribute dividends as noixDoG, which can then be held by the investors, or if they would prefer, can then take those dividends and convert them to another cryptocurrency or fiat through their preferred exchange.

A share issuer is not vulnerable to the failure of single stock exchange such as BTC Trading or Litecoin Global.

### About Peercoin
[Peercoin](http://peercoin.net/) (abbreviated PPC), also known as PPCoin and Peer-to-Peer Coin is the first [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) design introducing [proof-of-stake consensus](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](http://peercoin.net/bin/peercoin-paper.pdf)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Peercoin is based on [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), while introducing many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.


# Repo Guidelines

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion [**update88](http://) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
* For development ideas and help see **UPDATE**
